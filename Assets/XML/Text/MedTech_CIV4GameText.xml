		<English>[H1]Llywelyn the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prince of Gwynedd[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]ca. 1173 - 1240[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Llywelyn Fawr, or Llywelyn the Great, was born in Dolwyddelan Castle in North Wales.  Although Llywelyn had many family connections to royalty, it would not offer him any greater chance to gain a position of power.  In his early years, Llywelyn's primary enemy would be his uncle, Dafydd.  Dafydd had already killed his own brother and seized control of Gwynedd in Northwest Wales by the time Llywelyn was 22.  However, Dafydd had made many enemies on his ride to power.  Llywelyn led a successful revolution against Dafydd and defeated him in a battle at Aberconwy.  Llywelyn was not selfish, and showed early signs of his diplomatic skills by sharing the power of Gwynedd with his cousins.  Llywelyn ruled Dafydd's lands east of the Conwy River. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1200, Llywelyn's cousin Gruffud died.  Llywelyn now felt he had sufficient strength to move against Maredudd, his other cousin, and claimed to be the overlord of the whole of North Wales by expelling Maredudd from Llyn and capturing a strategic castle.  Llywelyn lead another invasion into Southern Powys, a territory of Gwenwynwyn, another Welsh opponent. [PARAGRAPH:1] By 1205, King John of England recognized the power of the Welsh prince, and offered his daughter Joan in marriage.  The alliance resulted in the arrest of Gwenwynwyn, enabling Llywelyn to seize control of his lands.  King John eventually realized he had gone too far in his support of Llywelyn.  Llywelyn then attacked the lands of the Earl of Chester, and King John was forced to go to war with Llywelyn.  The Welsh troops used guerilla tactics and raided the English troop's supplies, leaving King John no choice but to retreat to England. [PARAGRAPH:1]However, King John soon returned to Wales with a larger army.  The English army cut right into the heart of Gwynedd, forcing Llywelyn to send his English wife to sue for peace.  The terms of the peace were a serious set back for Llywelyn and he lost the right to lands east of the Conwy River. He was also made to forfeit 20,000 cattle and 40 horses to the English.  King John made other moves to ensure his defeat of Wales, and the Welsh, under Llywelyn, captured all the English Forts to free themselves of the English. [PARAGRAPH:2]When the English barons began conspiring against King John, he sought the aid of the Welsh. The Welsh gave no support to the king.  Llywelyn took the side of the King's enemies, and once more took control of South Wales.  An Alliance between the Welsh and the Anglo-Normans make certain that there would be peace on the borders.  After King John died, his son King Henry III made a treaty with Llywelyn.  Llywelyn knew that maintaining the whole of Wales would be difficult, so put other princes and lords in charge of the various districts, but still retained the position of Overlord.  Disputes with the Earl of Pembroke weakened Llywelyn, and only ended when the new Earl of Pembroke formed an alliance with the Welsh.  [PARAGRAPH:1]The new treaties kept a peace in Wales until Llywelyn's death in 1240, at the age of 68.  He died at Aberconwy Abbey and was interred there.</English>

		<English>[H1]Canute the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of England, Denmark, and Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]ca. 985 - 1035 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Cnut the Great, more commonly known as Canute, was a king of Denmark, England, Norway, and parts of Sweden, together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire. After the death of his heirs within a decade of his own and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was largely lost to history. Historian Norman Cantor has made the statement that he was "the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history", despite his not being Anglo-Saxon. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut was of Danish and Slavic descent. His father was Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark (which gave Cnut the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse Sveinsson). Cnut's mother was the daughter of the first duke of the Polans, Mieszko I; her name may have been Swietoslawa, but the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Cnut (published 2004) states that her name is unknown. [PARAGRAPH:1]As a prince of Denmark, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe. His accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together. Cnut maintained his power by uniting Danes and Englishmen under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, rather than by sheer brutality. After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia, Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028. The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut. He had coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation. [PARAGRAPH:1]The kingship of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, where Cnut, like his father before him, had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Gall-Ghaedhil, the Norse-Gaels, a people who dominated much of the Irish Sea region, including the Isle of Man, and western Scotland for a part of the Middle Ages; they were of Gaelic and North Germanic origin and as a whole exhibited a great deal of Gaelic and Norse cultural syncretism. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut's possession of England's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great leverage within the Church, gaining notable concessions from Pope Benedict VIII and his successor John XIX, such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops. A pallium is an ecclesiastical vestment that was originally peculiar to the Pope, but for many centuries bestowed by him on metropolitans and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction delegated to them by the Holy See. In that context it has remained connected to the papacy.  At the time of this concession, Cnut was able provide his bishops with pallia equal in value and ostentation to those worn by the Pope himself, a not insignificant matter. During the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor, Cnut also gained concessions on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome from other magnates of medieval Christendom. After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden, and on his way to Rome for this coronation, Cnut, in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects, stated himself to be "king of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes". Not an idle boast.  At the time, he was more powerful and wealthier than the Holy Roman Emperor. [PARAGRAPH:2]Cnut ruled England for almost twenty years. The protection he lent against Viking raiders - many of them under his command - restored the prosperity that had been increasingly impaired since the resumption of Viking attacks in the 980s. The resources he commanded in England helped him to establish control of the majority of Scandinavia, too. [PARAGRAPH:1]In July 1017, to consolidate his power, Cnut wed Emma of Normandy, the widow of &#198;thelred and daughter of Richard the Fearless, the first Duke of Normandy. With Edmund dead, Cnut was quick to eliminate any prospective challenge from the survivors of the Wessex dynasty. The first year of his reign was marked by the executions of a number of English noblemen whom he considered suspect. &#198;thelred's son Eadwig fled from England but was killed on Cnut's orders. Edmund Ironside's sons Edward and Edmund likewise fled abroad, Edward eventually to Hungary. Emma's sons by &#198;thelred, Edward the Confessor and Alfred Atheling, went into exile among their relatives in Normandy. Cnut put forward Harthacnut, his son by Emma, to be his heir; Svein Knutsson and Harold Harefoot, his two sons from his marriage to &#198;lfgifu of Northampton, his handfast wife, were kept on the sidelines. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1018, having collected a Danegeld amounting to the colossal sum of &#163;72,000 levied nationwide, with an additional &#163;10,500 extracted from London, Cnut paid off his army and sent most of them home. He retained 40 ships and their crews as a standing force in England. An annual tax called heregeld (army payment) was collected through the same system &#198;thelred had instituted in 1012 to reward Scandinavians in his service. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut extended the existing trend for multiple shires to be grouped together under a single ealdorman, dividing the country into four large administrative units whose geographical extent was based on the largest and most durable of the separate kingdoms that had preceded the unification of England. The officials responsible for these provinces were designated earls, a title of Scandinavian origin already in localised use in England, which now everywhere replaced that of ealdorman. Wessex was initially kept under Cnut's personal control, while Northumbria went to Erik of Hlathir, East Anglia to Thorkell the Tall, and Mercia remained in the hands of Eadric Streona. [PARAGRAPH:1]This initial distribution of power was short-lived. The chronically treacherous Eadric was executed within a year of Cnut's accession. Mercia passed to one of the leading families of the region, probably first to Leofwine, ealdorman of the Hwicce under &#198;thelred, but certainly soon to his son Leofric. In 1021 Thorkel the Tall also fell from favour and was outlawed. Following the death of Erik in the 1020s, he was succeeded as Earl of Northumbria by Siward, whose grandmother, Estrid (married to &#218;lfr Thorgilsson--a Viking chieftain and one of Cnut's most trusted men), was Cnut's sister. Bernicia, the northern part of Northumbria, was theoretically part of Erik and Siward's earldom, but throughout Cnut's reign it effectively remained under the control of the English dynasty based at Bamburgh, which had dominated the area at least since the early 10th century. They served as junior Earls of Bernicia under the titular authority of the Earl of Northumbria. By the 1030s Cnut's direct administration of Wessex had come to an end, with the establishment of an earldom under Godwin, an Englishman from a powerful Sussex family. In general, after initial reliance on his Scandinavian followers in the first years of his reign, Cnut allowed those Anglo-Saxon families of the existing English nobility who had earned his trust to assume rulership of his Earldoms. [PARAGRAPH:2]But by concentrating his efforts to secure control of England, Cnut's authority waned in Denmark and Norway.
At the Battle of Nesjar, in 1016, Olaf Haraldsson won the kingdom of Norway from the Danes. It was at some time after Eirkr left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erikr's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut's brother Harald may have been at Cnut's coronation, in 1016, returning to Denmark as its king, with part of the fleet, at some point thereafter. It is only certain, though, that there was an entry of his name, alongside Cnut's, in confraternity with Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1018. This is not conclusive, though, for the entry may have been made in Harald's absence, perhaps by the hand of Cnut himself, which means that, while it is usually thought that Harald died in 1018, it is unsure whether he was still alive at this point. Entry of his brother's name in the Canterbury codex may have been Cnut's attempt to make his vengeance for Harald's murder good with the Church. Of course, this may have been just a gesture for a soul to be under the protection of God. There is evidence Cnut was in battle with pirates in 1018, with his destruction of the crews of thirty ships, although it is unknown if this was off the English or Danish shores. He himself mentions troubles in his 1019 letter (to England, from Denmark), written as the King of England and Denmark. These events can be seen, with plausibility, to be in connection with the death of Harald. Cnut says he dealt with dissenters to ensure Denmark was free to assist England: [PARAGRAPH:2]"King Cnut greets in friendship his archbishop and his diocesan bishops and Earl Thurkil and all his earls... ecclesiatic and lay, in England... I inform you that I will be a gracious lord and a faithfull observer of God's rights and just secular law. (He exhorts his ealdormen to assist the bishops in the maintenance of) God's rights... and the benefit of the people. [PARAGRAPH:1]"If anyone, ecclesiastic or layman, Dane or Englishman, is so presumptuous as to defy God's law and my royal authority or the secular laws, and he will not make amends and desist according to the direction of my bishops, I then pray, and also command, Earl Thurkil, if he can, to cause the evil-doer to do right. And if he cannot, then it is my will that with the power of us both he shall destroy him in the land or drive him out of the land, whether he be of high or low rank. And it is my will that all the nation, ecclesiatical and lay, shall steadfastly observe Edgar's laws, which all men have chosen and sworn at Oxford. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Since I did not spare my money, as long as hostility was threatening you, I with God's help have put an end to it. Then I was informed that greater danger was approaching us than we liked at all; and then I went myself with the men who accompanied me to Denmark, from where the greatest injury had come to us, and with God's help I have made it so that never henceforth shall hostility reach you from there as long as you support me rightly and my life lasts. Now I thank Almighty God for his help and his mercy, that I have settled the great dangers which were approaching us that we need fear no danger to us from there; but we may rekon on full help and deliverance, if we need it" [NEWLINE]--Cnut's letter of 1019 [PARAGRAPH:2]Cnut was generally remembered as a wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the Church, keeper of the historic record.

He reinstated the Laws of King Edgar to allow for the constitution of a Danelaw, and for the activity of Scandinavians at large.

		<French>[H1]Cnut le Grand[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of England, Denmark, and Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]ca. 985 - 1035 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Cnut the Great, more commonly known as Canute, was a king of Denmark, England, Norway, and parts of Sweden, together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire. After the death of his heirs within a decade of his own and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was largely lost to history. Historian Norman Cantor has made the statement that he was "the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history", despite his not being Anglo-Saxon. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut was of Danish and Slavic descent. His father was Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark (which gave Cnut the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse Sveinsson). Cnut's mother was the daughter of the first duke of the Polans, Mieszko I; her name may have been Swietoslawa, but the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Cnut (published 2004) states that her name is unknown. [PARAGRAPH:1]As a prince of Denmark, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe. His accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together. Cnut maintained his power by uniting Danes and Englishmen under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, rather than by sheer brutality. After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia, Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028. The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut. He had coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation. [PARAGRAPH:1]The kingship of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, where Cnut, like his father before him, had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Gall-Ghaedhil, the Norse-Gaels, a people who dominated much of the Irish Sea region, including the Isle of Man, and western Scotland for a part of the Middle Ages; they were of Gaelic and North Germanic origin and as a whole exhibited a great deal of Gaelic and Norse cultural syncretism. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut's possession of England's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great leverage within the Church, gaining notable concessions from Pope Benedict VIII and his successor John XIX, such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops. A pallium is an ecclesiastical vestment that was originally peculiar to the Pope, but for many centuries bestowed by him on metropolitans and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction delegated to them by the Holy See. In that context it has remained connected to the papacy.  At the time of this concession, Cnut was able provide his bishops with pallia equal in value and ostentation to those worn by the Pope himself, a not insignificant matter. During the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor, Cnut also gained concessions on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome from other magnates of medieval Christendom. After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden, and on his way to Rome for this coronation, Cnut, in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects, stated himself to be "king of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes". Not an idle boast.  At the time, he was more powerful and wealthier than the Holy Roman Emperor. [PARAGRAPH:2]Cnut ruled England for almost twenty years. The protection he lent against Viking raiders - many of them under his command - restored the prosperity that had been increasingly impaired since the resumption of Viking attacks in the 980s. The resources he commanded in England helped him to establish control of the majority of Scandinavia, too. [PARAGRAPH:1]In July 1017, to consolidate his power, Cnut wed Emma of Normandy, the widow of &#198;thelred and daughter of Richard the Fearless, the first Duke of Normandy. With Edmund dead, Cnut was quick to eliminate any prospective challenge from the survivors of the Wessex dynasty. The first year of his reign was marked by the executions of a number of English noblemen whom he considered suspect. &#198;thelred's son Eadwig fled from England but was killed on Cnut's orders. Edmund Ironside's sons Edward and Edmund likewise fled abroad, Edward eventually to Hungary. Emma's sons by &#198;thelred, Edward the Confessor and Alfred Atheling, went into exile among their relatives in Normandy. Cnut put forward Harthacnut, his son by Emma, to be his heir; Svein Knutsson and Harold Harefoot, his two sons from his marriage to &#198;lfgifu of Northampton, his handfast wife, were kept on the sidelines. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1018, having collected a Danegeld amounting to the colossal sum of &#163;72,000 levied nationwide, with an additional &#163;10,500 extracted from London, Cnut paid off his army and sent most of them home. He retained 40 ships and their crews as a standing force in England. An annual tax called heregeld (army payment) was collected through the same system &#198;thelred had instituted in 1012 to reward Scandinavians in his service. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut extended the existing trend for multiple shires to be grouped together under a single ealdorman, dividing the country into four large administrative units whose geographical extent was based on the largest and most durable of the separate kingdoms that had preceded the unification of England. The officials responsible for these provinces were designated earls, a title of Scandinavian origin already in localised use in England, which now everywhere replaced that of ealdorman. Wessex was initially kept under Cnut's personal control, while Northumbria went to Erik of Hlathir, East Anglia to Thorkell the Tall, and Mercia remained in the hands of Eadric Streona. [PARAGRAPH:1]This initial distribution of power was short-lived. The chronically treacherous Eadric was executed within a year of Cnut's accession.

[PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut's possession of England's dioceses and the continental Diocese of Denmark - with a claim laid upon it by the Holy Roman Empire's Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen - was a source of great leverage within the Church, gaining notable concessions from Pope Benedict VIII and his successor John XIX, such as one on the price of the pallium of his bishops. A pallium is an ecclesiastical vestment that was originally peculiar to the Pope, but for many centuries bestowed by him on metropolitans and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction delegated to them by the Holy See. In that context it has remained connected to the papacy.  At the time of this concession, Cnut was able provide his bishops with pallia equal in value and ostentation to those worn by the Pope himself, a not insignificant matter. During the coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor, Cnut also gained concessions on the tolls his people had to pay on the way to Rome from other magnates of medieval Christendom. After his 1026 victory against Norway and Sweden, and on his way to Rome for this coronation, Cnut, in a letter written for the benefit of his subjects, stated himself to be "king of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes". Not an idle boast.  At the time, he was more powerful and wealthier than the Holy Roman Emperor. [PARAGRAPH:2]Cnut ruled England for almost twenty years. The protection he lent against Viking raiders - many of them under his command - restored the prosperity that had been increasingly impaired since the resumption of Viking attacks in the 980s. The resources he commanded in England helped him to establish control of the majority of Scandinavia, too. [PARAGRAPH:1]In July 1017, to consolidate his power, Cnut wed Emma of Normandy, the widow of &#198;thelred and daughter of Richard the Fearless, the first Duke of Normandy. With Edmund dead, Cnut was quick to eliminate any prospective challenge from the survivors of the Wessex dynasty. The first year of his reign was marked by the executions of a number of English noblemen whom he considered suspect. &#198;thelred's son Eadwig fled from England but was killed on Cnut's orders. Edmund Ironside's sons Edward and Edmund likewise fled abroad, Edward eventually to Hungary. Emma's sons by &#198;thelred, Edward the Confessor and Alfred Atheling, went into exile among their relatives in Normandy. Cnut put forward Harthacnut, his son by Emma, to be his heir; Svein Knutsson and Harold Harefoot, his two sons from his marriage to &#198;lfgifu of Northampton, his handfast wife, were kept on the sidelines. [PARAGRAPH:1]In 1018, having collected a Danegeld amounting to the colossal sum of &#163;72,000 levied nationwide, with an additional &#163;10,500 extracted from London, Cnut paid off his army and sent most of them home. He retained 40 ships and their crews as a standing force in England. An annual tax called heregeld (army payment) was collected through the same system &#198;thelred had instituted in 1012 to reward Scandinavians in his service. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut extended the existing trend for multiple shires to be grouped together under a single ealdorman, dividing the country into four large administrative units whose geographical extent was based on the largest and most durable of the separate kingdoms that had preceded the unification of England. The officials responsible for these provinces were designated earls, a title of Scandinavian origin already in localised use in England, which now everywhere replaced that of ealdorman. Wessex was initially kept under Cnut's personal control, while Northumbria went to Erik of Hlathir, East Anglia to Thorkell the Tall, and Mercia remained in the hands of Eadric Streona. [PARAGRAPH:1]This initial distribution of power was short-lived. The chronically treacherous Eadric was executed within a year of Cnut's accession. Mercia passed to one of the leading families of the region, probably first to Leofwine, ealdorman of the Hwicce under &#198;thelred, but certainly soon to his son Leofric. In 1021 Thorkel the Tall also fell from favour and was outlawed. Following the death of Erik in the 1020s, he was succeeded as Earl of Northumbria by Siward, whose grandmother, Estrid (married to &#218;lfr Thorgilsson--a Viking chieftain and one of Cnut's most trusted men), was Cnut's sister. Bernicia, the northern part of Northumbria, was theoretically part of Erik and Siward's earldom, but throughout Cnut's reign it effectively remained under the control of the English dynasty based at Bamburgh, which had dominated the area at least since the early 10th century. They served as junior Earls of Bernicia under the titular authority of the Earl of Northumbria. By the 1030s Cnut's direct administration of Wessex had come to an end, with the establishment of an earldom under Godwin, an Englishman from a powerful Sussex family. In general, after initial reliance on his Scandinavian followers in the first years of his reign, Cnut allowed those Anglo-Saxon families of the existing English nobility who had earned his trust to assume rulership of his Earldoms. [PARAGRAPH:2]But by concentrating his efforts to secure control of England, Cnut's authority waned in Denmark and Norway.
At the Battle of Nesjar, in 1016, Olaf Haraldsson won the kingdom of Norway from the Danes. It was at some time after Eirkr left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erikr's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut's brother Harald may have been at Cnut's coronation, in 1016, returning to Denmark as its king, with part of the fleet, at some point thereafter. It is only certain, though, that there was an entry of his name, alongside Cnut's, in confraternity with Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1018. This is not conclusive, though, for the entry may have been made in Harald's absence, perhaps by the hand of Cnut himself, which means that, while it is usually thought that Harald died in 1018, it is unsure whether he was still alive at this point. Entry of his brother's name in the Canterbury codex may have been Cnut's attempt to make his vengeance for Harald's murder good with the Church. Of course, this may have been just a gesture for a soul to be under the protection of God. There is evidence Cnut was in battle with pirates in 1018, with his destruction of the crews of thirty ships, although it is unknown if this was off the English or Danish shores. He himself mentions troubles in his 1019 letter (to England, from Denmark), written as the King of England and Denmark. These events can be seen, with plausibility, to be in connection with the death of Harald. Cnut says he dealt with dissenters to ensure Denmark was free to assist England: [PARAGRAPH:2]"King Cnut greets in friendship his archbishop and his diocesan bishops and Earl Thurkil and all his earls... ecclesiatic and lay, in England... I inform you that I will be a gracious lord and a faithfull observer of God's rights and just secular law. (He exhorts his ealdormen to assist the bishops in the maintenance of) God's rights... and the benefit of the people. [PARAGRAPH:1]"If anyone, ecclesiastic or layman, Dane or Englishman, is so presumptuous as to defy God's law and my royal authority or the secular laws, and he will not make amends and desist according to the direction of my bishops, I then pray, and also command, Earl Thurkil, if he can, to cause the evil-doer to do right. And if he cannot, then it is my will that with the power of us both he shall destroy him in the land or drive him out of the land, whether he be of high or low rank. And it is my will that all the nation, ecclesiatical and lay, shall steadfastly observe Edgar's laws, which all men have chosen and sworn at Oxford. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Since I did not spare my money, as long as hostility was threatening you, I with God's help have put an end to it. Then I was informed that greater danger was approaching us than we liked at all; and then I went myself with the men who accompanied me to Denmark, from where the greatest injury had come to us, and with God's help I have made it so that never henceforth shall hostility reach you from there as long as you support me rightly and my life lasts. Now I thank Almighty God for his help and his mercy, that I have settled the great dangers which were approaching us that we need fear no danger to us from there; but we may rekon on full help and deliverance, if we need it" [NEWLINE]--Cnut's letter of 1019 [PARAGRAPH:2]Cnut was generally remembered as a wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the Church, keeper of the historic record. Accordingly, we hear of him, even today, as a religious man (see below), despite the fact that he was in an arguably sinful relationship, with two wives, and the harsh treatment he dealt his fellow Christian opponents. [PARAGRAPH:1]Under his reign, Cnut brought together the English and Danish kingdoms, and the people saw a golden age of dominance across Scandinavia, as well as within the British Isles. His campaigns abroad meant the tables of Viking supremacy were stacked in favour of the English, turning the prows of the longships towards Scandinavia. He reinstated the Laws of King Edgar to allow for the constitution of a Danelaw, and for the activity of Scandinavians at large. He also reinstituted the extant laws with a series of proclamations to assuage common grievances brought to his attention, including: "On Inheritance in case of Intestacy", and "On Heriots and Reliefs". He also strengthened the currency, initiating a reform of coins so that those in use in England were of equal weight to those being used in Denmark and other parts of Scandinavia, and thus English coinage came to be accepted for purchases by traders as far away as Constantinople and Damascus.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Canuto el Grande[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of England, Denmark, and Norway[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]ca. 985 - 1035 [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Cnut the Great, more commonly known as Canute, was a king of Denmark, England, Norway, and parts of Sweden, together often referred to as the Anglo-Scandinavian or North Sea Empire. After the death of his heirs within a decade of his own and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, his legacy was largely lost to history. Historian Norman Cantor has made the statement that he was "the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history", despite his not being Anglo-Saxon. [PARAGRAPH:1]Cnut was of Danish and Slavic descent. His father was Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark (which gave Cnut the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse Sveinsson). Cnut's mother was the daughter of the first duke of the Polans, Mieszko I; her name may have been Swietoslawa, but the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Cnut (published 2004) states that her name is unknown. [PARAGRAPH:1]As a prince of Denmark, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe. His accession to the Danish throne in 1018 brought the crowns of England and Denmark together. Cnut maintained his power by uniting Danes and Englishmen under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, rather than by sheer brutality. After a decade of conflict with opponents in Scandinavia, Cnut claimed the crown of Norway in Trondheim in 1028. The Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut. He had coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation. [PARAGRAPH:1]The kingship of England lent the Danes an important link to the maritime zone between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, where Cnut, like his father before him, had a strong interest and wielded much influence among the Gall-Ghaedhil, the Norse-Gaels, a people who dominated much of the Irish Sea region, including the Isle of Man, and western Scotland for a part of the Middle Ages; they were of Gaelic and North Germanic origin and as a whole exhibited a great deal of Gaelic and Norse cultural syncretism.

		<English>[TAB]Arguably the most useful domesticated animal in mankind's history, horses have existed for some 50 million years. While significant evolution has taken place (early ancestors were under a foot tall), the basic appearance of the horse has remained relatively unchanged. The earliest interaction between horses and men was that of game, with early man hunting them for food. Around 2500 BC, the first signs of domesticated breeds began appearing in Asia, but the idea took hold and spread rapidly. The contributions of the horse to man's conquest of his fellow man were immense, enabling the vast campaigns by Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. The Spaniards introduced the modern breed to North America in the 16th Century, often turning their imported herds loose before returning to Europe (making valuable room for gold and other treasures). While the importance of horses has dwindled since the advent of the internal combustion engine, they remain a boon in the realms of entertainment and farming.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Stone has always been and remains one of the most important human building materials. In fact, stone tools predate human history. It appears as if the first stone tools were used by Paranthropus, an ancestor of man who lived about two million years ago. [PARAGRAPH:1]Most stone tools are created by chipping or grinding. The former is used when working with crystalline materials such as flint, chert and obsidian. The worker taps the stone with a harder stone, carefully chipping off stone flakes until the stone has been properly shaped. Mesoamerican tribes used this method to make their sharp and deadly obsidian swords. [PARAGRAPH:1]The grinding method is used when working with harder and coarser materials such as basalt and granite. This is a long and tedious process in which the toolmaker repeatedly grinds away the stone with a harder material or with sand, sometimes using water as a lubricant. Many of the earliest European stone axes were made using this process.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Gold has always been one of the most highly valued metals in the world. It is used in the manufacture of everything from jewelry to electronics, and has been established as the basis for monetary systems world wide. The factor that makes gold valuable is its rarity. Although gold can be found in many different areas, the most valuable deposits are large veins of gold ore running through mountains. When a large deposit is found, mining the deposit greatly boosts the economy in settlements and cities near the mine. An historical example of this phenomenon are the many towns that grew and prospered over a relatively short time during the California gold rush in America during the 1800's.</English>

Silk is obtained from the cocoon of the silkworm moth, which was originally native to the forests of China. The fine fibers of the cocoon are woven into cloth, which is used to make all types of clothing. Raw silk was obtained only from Asia until 550 AD, when two monks sent from the Roman Empire secretly stole silkworm eggs from China and brought them to Europe. Eventually, silkworms were found in many areas throughout the world.

The Romans were the first people to attempt to breed cattle to promote specific traits over others. Their ability to survive in arid areas unsuitable for farming became a premier benefit of these new breeds.

Urspr&#252;nglich durchstreiften sie als wilde Herden Asien, Afrika und Europa. In der Fr&#252;hzeit dienten sie den Menschen als Handelsgut und Nahrungsquelle und verrichteten schwere Arbeiten. Sp&#228;ter wurde die Rolle des bevorzugten Lasttiers vom Pferd &#252;bernommen. Die R&#246;mer waren die Ersten, die sich an der Viehzucht versuchten, um bestimmte Eigenschaften zu verst&#228;rken. Ihre Neuz&#252;chtungen zeichneten sich vor allem durch ihre F&#228;higkeit aus, selbst in unwirtlichen Gegenden &#252;berleben zu k&#246;nnen, die sich nicht f&#252;r die landwirtschaftliche Bebauung eigneten. Im Jahre 1521 brachten die Spanier Weidevieh nach Mexiko und in die Neue Welt, woraufhin vor allem in Texas und den benachbarten Regionen zahlreiche Viehzucht-Ranchen entstanden. Heute wird der Viehbestand allein in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika auf mehr als 100 Millionen Tiere beziffert.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Discendenti del bufalo e del bisonte, i bovini hanno ricoperto molti ruoli nella storia dell'umanit&#224;. Originariamente, i bovini si aggiravano in branchi selvatici in una zona che si estendeva tra Asia, Africa ed Europa. Inizialmente, queste bestie fornivano all'uomo forza lavoro, oltre a beni per il commercio e cibo; ben presto vennero rimpiazzati come bestie da soma dai cavalli. I Romani furono i primi a tentare di allevare i bovini e cercare di adattarne le caratteristiche; la loro abilit&#224; di sopravvivenza in zone aride non adatte all'agricoltura divenne una delle caratteristiche principali di queste nuove razze. Nel 1521, gli Spagnoli introdussero i bovini nel Nuovo Mondo e in Messico, promuovendo grandi allevamenti di bestiame in Texas e nelle regioni circostanti. Oggigiorno, solamente negli Stati Uniti vengono allevati cento milioni di capi di bestiame.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Descendientes del b&#250;falo y el bisonte, las reses han tenido muchas aplicaciones en el pasado y el presente del hombre. En un principio, los reba&#241;os salvajes de reses deambulaban por amplias zonas de Asia, &#193;frica y Europa. Empezaron contribuyendo a la humanidad con trabajo, alimento y bienes, aunque el caballo pronto los reemplaz&#243; como animal de carga preferido. Los romanos fueron los primeros en intentar la cr&#237;a de ganado con est&#237;mulo de rasgos especiales. Su capacidad para sobrevivir en regiones &#225;ridas poco propicias para la agricultura se convirti&#243; en una ventaja fundamental de estas nuevas especies. En 1521 los espa&#241;oles llevaron las reses a M&#233;xico y el Nuevo Mundo, lo que condujo a una gran industria ganadera en Texas y otras regiones lim&#237;trofes. En la actualidad, solo en Estados Unidos hay m&#225;s de cien millones de cabezas de ganado.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]For centuries, sheep have had associations with many Mediterranean cultures. Many religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, use sheep-related images and parables. Raising sheep provided a steady source of income to ancient farmers since the animal can give milk, wool, and meat. Even in the 21st Century, sheep can provide a return on investment of up to 400%% of their annual cost (including reproduction gains).</English>
		<French>[TAB]Le mouton est depuis des si&#232;cles associ&#233; &#224; de nombreuses civilisations m&#233;diterran&#233;ennes. De nombreuses religions, comme le Juda&#239;sme et le Christianisme, utilisent des paraboles et une imagerie se rapportant au mouton. L'&#233;levage de mouton offrait une source de revenus r&#233;guli&#232;re aux agriculteurs de l'Antiquit&#233;, cet animal offrant du lait, de la laine et de la viande. Encore aujourd'hui, le mouton peut offrir un retour sur investissement de l'ordre de 400 %% de son co&#251;t annuel (b&#233;n&#233;fice de la reproduction compris).</French>
